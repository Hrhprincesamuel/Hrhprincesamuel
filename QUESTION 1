1. **Scope and Protocol**: The internet refers to the global network of interconnected computers and devices, enabling communication and data exchange through various protocols. In contrast, the World Wide Web (WWW) is a specific system within the internet that facilitates accessing and viewing multimedia content, primarily through HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).

2. **Functionality**: The internet encompasses a wide range of services beyond the WWW, including email, file sharing, online gaming, and more. Conversely, the WWW specifically focuses on providing access to websites, web pages, and web-based applications through browsers.

3. **Infrastructure vs. Application Layer**: The internet operates at the infrastructure layer, providing the foundational connectivity between devices. On the other hand, the WWW operates at the application layer, offering services and content that users interact with through browsers.

4. **Universal vs. Specific Access**: The internet provides a platform for various services and applications to operate, accessible through different protocols and technologies. In contrast, the WWW offers a specific interface for accessing web-based content, primarily through browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

5. **Evolution and Development**: The internet has evolved over decades, originating from ARPANET and expanding into a global network connecting billions of devices. The WWW, however, emerged later as a way to navigate and access information on the internet, evolving from Tim Berners-Lee's proposal in 1989 and gaining widespread adoption in the 1990s.1. **Scope and Protocol**: The internet refers to the global network of interconnected computers and devices, enabling communication and data exchange through various protocols.
